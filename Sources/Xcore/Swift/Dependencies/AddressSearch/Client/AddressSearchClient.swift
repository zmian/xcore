///
/// This client defines methods for performing address searches, resolving
/// search results into complete addresses, validating addresses, and observing
/// search updates in real time.
///
/// Implementations of this protocol may integrate with third-party APIs or
/// local search databases.
///
/// **Usage**
///
/// ```swift
/// class ViewModel {
///     @Dependency(\.addressSearch) var addressSearch
///
///     func address() async throws {
///         let address = try await addressSearch.query("One Apple Park Way")
///         print(address)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The query parameter should be a **partial** or **full** address string,
/// similar to what users would enter in a search field.

    /// or any other location-based keyword. The search is performed locally and may
    /// integrate with external services if necessary.

    /// - Throws: An error if validation fails.
    func validate(_ address: PostalAddress) async throws

    ///
