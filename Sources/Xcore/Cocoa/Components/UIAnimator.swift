/// A wrapper for `UIViewPropertyAnimator` that runs an animation and executes a
/// completion handler when finished.
///
/// This structure creates and starts a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` with a
/// specified duration, animation block, and completion block. It retains a
/// reference to the in-flight animator and provides a method to cancel the
/// animation if needed.
///
/// **Usage**
///
/// ```swift
/// var animator = UIAnimator(duration: 1.0) {
///     // Define your animations here.
/// } completion: {
///     // Perform actions upon completion.
/// }
///
/// // Cancel the animation when necessary.
/// animator.cancel()
/// ```

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - duration: The duration of the animation, in seconds.
    ///   - animations: A closure that defines the animations to perform.
    ///   - completion: A closure called when the animation finishes.
