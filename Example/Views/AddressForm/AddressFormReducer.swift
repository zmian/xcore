/// `AddressForm` encapsulates the logic required to allow users to search for
/// an address, select a search result, edit the address if needed, and finally
/// validate and confirm the address.
///
/// **Usage**
///
/// ```swift
/// let store = Store(
///     initialState: .init(navigationTitle: "Enter Address"),
///     reducer: {
///         AddressForm()
///     }
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Parent views can subscribe to the store's `addressSuccess` action to be
/// notified of selected address.
